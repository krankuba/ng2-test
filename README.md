## Build and Run the App

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```


## Prerequisite: Install Node.js and npm

If Node.js and npm aren't already on your machine, install them. Our examples require node v4.x.x or higher and npm 3.x.x or higher. To check which version you are using, run node -v and npm -v in a terminal window.
